# Spam-Ham-Message-Classification-NLP

In this project we classify the text messages given to us into HAM(legitmate) or SPAM using Natural Language Processing by using the NLTK package. The model gives an amazing accuracy of 0.96.

We'll be using a dataset from the [UCI datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)! This dataset is already located in the folder for this section.The file we are using contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages. You can check out the **readme** file for more info.
